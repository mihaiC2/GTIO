# Decision: Backend Development Technology

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Mihail, Yasin, Roberto, Nikol, Jazmin
* Date: 2025-02-07

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a technology stack for developing the backend of our application. The selected technology should ensure maintainability, scalability, developer productivity, and ecosystem support.

## Decision Drivers

* Strong type safety to reduce runtime errors
* Large community support and ecosystem
* Good developer experience and tooling
* Compatibility with modern backend frameworks
* Performance and maintainability

## Considered Options

* TypeScript
* JavaScript (Node.js without TypeScript)
* Python
* Go

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TypeScript", because it offers strong type safety, integrates well with modern Node.js frameworks, has excellent tooling, and is widely adopted in the industry.

### Positive Consequences

* Improved code maintainability and readability due to static typing
* Early detection of errors during development
* Better IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring tools
* Compatibility with modern backend frameworks

### Negative Consequences

* Slightly increased learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript
* Requires compilation step, adding some build complexity

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### TypeScript

* Good, because it provides type safety, reducing runtime errors.
* Good, because it has strong IDE support and developer tooling.
* Good, because it integrates seamlessly with JavaScript and Node.js.
* Bad, because it introduces a compilation step.

### JavaScript (Node.js without TypeScript)

* Good, because it has no compilation step and is more familiar to many developers.
* Good, because it has a vast ecosystem and community.
* Bad, because it lacks static typing, leading to more potential runtime errors.
* Bad, because large codebases become harder to maintain over time.

### Python

* Good, because it has a simple and readable syntax.
* Good, because it has a strong ecosystem for data processing and AI.
* Bad, because it has lower performance compared to Node.js.
* Bad, because it lacks seamless integration with existing frontend JavaScript code.

### Go

* Good, because it has high performance and efficiency.
* Good, because it has strong built-in concurrency support.
* Bad, because it has a smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js.
* Bad, because it requires developers to learn a new language.
