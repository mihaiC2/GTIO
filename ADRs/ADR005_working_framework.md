* Date: 2025-02-09

## Context and Problem Statement

For the management of our project, we need to choose a working framework that enables efficiency, collaboration, and adaptability to changing requirements. The decision must consider factors such as flexibility, team collaboration, and iterative improvement.

## Decision Drivers

* Adaptability to changing requirements
* Efficient team collaboration
* Incremental and iterative development
* Transparency and continuous feedback
* Improved risk management

## Considered Options

* Scrum
* Waterfall development
* Traditional predictive methodology

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Scrum, because it promotes iterative development, team collaboration, and flexibility in responding to changes.

### Positive Consequences

* Increased adaptability to evolving project needs
* Enhanced collaboration and communication within the team
* Regular feedback loops leading to continuous improvement

### Negative Consequences

* Requires commitment to Agile principles and practices

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Scrum

* Good, because it allows for iterative development and continuous feedback
* Good, because it enhances team collaboration and transparency
* Bad, because it requires discipline and commitment to Agile principles

### Waterfall Development

* Good, because it provides a clear and structured approach
* Good, because it defines all requirements upfront
* Bad, because it lacks flexibility to accommodate changes
* Bad, because it can lead to long development cycles without early feedback

### Traditional Predictive Methodology

* Good, because it offers clear structures for each development phase.
* Bad, because it does not provide the same level of flexibility and adaptability as Agile methodologies.
