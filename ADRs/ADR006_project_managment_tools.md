## Context and Problem Statement

For the effective management of our project, we need to choose a set of tools that facilitate internal communication, task and sprint management, decision documentation, and file sharing. The decision must consider factors such as usability, integration, cost, and efficiency.

## Decision Drivers

* Ease of use and team familiarity with the tools
* Integration with existing workflows
* Cost-effectiveness
* Scalability for future needs
* Collaboration and accessibility

## Considered Options

* Discord 
* Trello 
* GitHub 
* Google Drive 
* GitLab
* Microsoft Teams
* Jira
* GSuite
* Excel and similar apps
* ClickUp
* Asana
* OpenProject
* ProjectLibre
* Zentao

## Decision Outcome
Chosen Options:

1. Discord for internal communication and meetings because it enhances communication with voice and text capabilities.
2. Trello for sprint and task management because it simplifies sprint planning and task tracking using an intuitive and visual-friendly Kanban board system instead of GitHub issues. 
3. GitHub for decision documentation and code repository. It centralizes decision documentation and ensures proper version control for code and documentation. GitHub is widely used in the industry and it's very documented.
4. Google Drive for internal document sharing, it facilitates easy access to shared documents and enables real-time collaboration.

### Positive Consequences

- Streamlined communication with Discord's voice and text features
- Efficient task management with Trello's kanban boards
- Centralized version control and documentation with GitHub
- Easy document sharing and collaboration through Google Drive

### Negative Consequences

- Potential distractions from Discord's informal nature
- Trello may become cluttered for large-scale project management
